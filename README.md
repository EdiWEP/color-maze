<h2>Description</h2>
	<p>Color Maze is an isometric puzzle game where the player has to navigate through a series of incresingly difficult levels while trying to collect as many coins as possible to reach a higher score. Color Maze tries to challenge the player's creativity, memory and attention to detail through the handcrafted levels	</p>

<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<p>The main mechanics of the game are revolved around the player's body color and their gun color. When these match certain objects in the environment, the player can make them dissapear in order to open up different paths through the levels. The colors can change based on collectible items found throughout the levels. In order to succeed, the order of the player's actions is very important, because once a color changes, there is no way to get it back unless the player finds another collectible of that color and type.</p>
